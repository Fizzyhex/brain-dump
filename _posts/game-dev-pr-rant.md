# Game Dev PR Images Fucking Suck

Development is unpredictable. So your beta wasn't well received, you missed a promised deadline, or you need to address controversy. Or whatever.

And so the PR team or marketing guys get to work on typing up a hyper-optimised, wordy, corporate statement apologising and talking about how 'the developers' are so sorry, and how they're 'committed to delivering the \[FRANCHISE HERE] experience that you all know and love'.

Whenever I see one of these branded statement sheets I have a knee-jerk negative reaction and look down on the organisation spat it out. And then even more-so after actual reading what they have to say. Today, I was struggling to rationalise why.

It's the way that these statements are written on behalf of the developers who (might, somewhat, or deeply) care about the product in question by people who are paid to 'show how much you care' for you. It's the PR equivalent of cheating on your partner, and then paying a middleman to apologise to show up at their house and apologise for you. If you truly care and mean it, **you would do it yourself**.

Although this may not be something your players think about when they read your statements, there is nothing special about this realisation. I think it still has the same affect on the statement's audience subconsciously, even if to varying degrees.

I see Andrew Bosworth (CTO of Meta) respond to questions and concerns regarding headsets in his Instagram story posts. It's effective, as instead of a robotic message, it attaches a face to the statements. Although Meta obviously doesn't have the best reputation and track record, I think this is something they do well.

Instead of shitting out statement sheets on your corporate Twitter account, a better approach may be to have a lead developer make a public statement about how they missed the mark, and how you plan to navigate the issue. You can then echo it by retweeting and posting around as needed. These people are getting paid to maintain company images, and they could be doing better.
